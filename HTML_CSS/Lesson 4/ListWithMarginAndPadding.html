                <li class="item">In information systems, a tag is a keyword or term assigned to a piece of information
                    (such as an Internet bookmark, digital image, database record, or computer file). This kind of
                    metadata helps describe an item and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching.<sup>[1]</sup> Tags
                    are generally chosen informally and personally by the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on
                    the system, although they may also be chosen from a controlled vocabulary.<sup>[2]</sup>

        <li class="head"> <span>ATTRIBUTE</span>
            <ol>
                <li class="item">HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's
                    behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the
                    default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable
                    to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li class="head"> <span>ELEMENT</span>
            <ol>
                <li class="item">An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
                    document or web page.[vague] HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. Each node
                    can have HTML attributes specified. Nodes can also have content, including other nodes and text.
                    Many HTML nodes represent semantics, or meaning. For example, the &lt;title&gt; node represents the title
                        of the document.
